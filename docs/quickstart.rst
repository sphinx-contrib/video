You can now add video directly in your documentation:

.. code-block:: rst

    .. video:: _static/video.mp4
        :nocontrols:
        :loop:
        :poster: _static/image.png

.. video:: _static/video.mp4
    :nocontrols:
    :autoplay:
    :muted:
    :loop:

Advanced Usage
--------------

The browser used by the user may not support the codec of the primary source set in the directive. The ``<video>`` tag offers the possibility to add multiple sources, the first one compatible being the one displayed on screen. To use this options simply add the alternative source as a second argument to your video:

.. code-block:: rst

    .. video:: _static/video.webm _static/video.mp4

.. video:: _static/video.webm _static/video.mp4

.. note::

    to enforce this behavior set the sphinx parameter ``video_enforce_extra_source`` to ``True`` in your conf.py, it will then raise a warning when a secondary source is missing.

    .. code-block:: python

        # conf.py

        video_enforce_extra_source = True
